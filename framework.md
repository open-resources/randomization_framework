# Randomization Framework
| Level | Label | Description | Purpose |Example Question|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | Standard | Standard questions with no randomization. | - | Abdallah drops a 3 kg ball from the top of a 20 m tall building. How long does the ball take to hit the ground? |
| 1 | Surface features | Change surface level features (e.g., names, colours, phrases). | Increased cognitive load for students when they are pattern matching. | {{Abdallah}} drops a 3 kg {{ball}} from the top of a 20 m tall {{building}}. How long does the {{ball}} take to hit the ground? |
| 2 | Conditions | Change problem conditions and values within a scenario. | Repeated retrieval practice so students can do their own work even in group settings. | Abdallah drops a {{3}} kg ball from the top of a {{20}} m tall building. How long does the ball take to hit the ground? |
| 3 | Scenarios | Assess the same concept with different scenarios. | Intentional pattern-matching so students can synthesize patterns to learn concepts and understand how to apply them. | Abdallah {{throws a ball up}} and it travels a height of 20 m {{until it stops}}. How long does the ball take to hit the ground? |
| 4 | Concepts | Assess different concepts. | Students need to understand concepts deeply and cannot pattern-match efficiently. | Abdallah drops a 3 kg ball from the top of a 20 m tall building. What is its {{velocity}} just before it hits the ground? |
| 5 | Different Questions | Completely different questions. | Allows for multiple attempts of assessments for repeat (or second-chance) testing. | {{Abdallah drops a 3 kg ball, a 5 kg box, and a 1 kg backpack from the top of a 20 m tall building. Rank the items in the order they hit the ground.}} |
