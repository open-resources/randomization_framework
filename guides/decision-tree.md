# Decision Tree
To minimize potential disagreement between reviewers classifying the randomization levels present in a question, we developed a decision tree to guide reviewers during the application of 
[our randomization framework](https://github.com/open-resources/randomization_framework/blob/main/framework.md). 
The tree outlines sequential steps and poses relevant questions to facilitate the systematic application of the framework. 
The levels within the framework are not mutually exclusive, allowing a single question to be associated with multiple levels based on the characteristics of its randomized features. 
Consequently, the rating process is iterative, starting with the identification of all variable features within a question and then having each feature assigned to a specific randomization level.
